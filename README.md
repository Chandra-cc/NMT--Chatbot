# NMT--Chatbot
Introduction nmt-chatbot is the implementation of chatbot using NMT - Neural Machine Translation (seq2seq). Includes BPE/WPM-like tokenizator (own implementation). Main purpose of that project is to make an NMT chatbot, but it's fully compatible with NMT and still can be used for sentence translations between two languages.
